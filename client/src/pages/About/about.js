              Hi there! Iâ€™m Vedant Patel, currently pursuing a B.Tech in
              Computer Science and Engineering at Nirma University. I am
              proficient in C++ and have practical experience with JavaScript
              and Express. My toolset includes VS Code, Git, and SQL, and I am
              familiar with Java, HTML, Shell Script, Python, Vue, Tailwind,
              Logisim, Cisco Packet Tracer, and MongoDB. One of my notable
              projects is an E-Commerce Website, a multipage web application for
              selling electronics. This project involved storing user profiles,
              managing carts, and handling purchased items using HTML, Tailwind,
              MongoDB Atlas, Express, and NodeMailer.
